The most popular of the lot has been the Redmi Note 3 and at the time of writing this, it is arguably the best smartphone to buy under Rs 15,000.\n");
        //tv1.setText("At its price, the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime is quite a feature packed smartphone. Yes, it looks small and that is exactly why we appreciate Xiaomiâ€™s efforts in stuffing the smartphone to its limits. There is a 5-inch HD IPS LCD display which looks neat and inside, there is a new Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 octa-core processor which is clocked at 1.4GHz. You also get 3GB RAM and 32GB of internal storage. The storage can be expanded further using a microSD card of up to 256GB in size. The camera department comprises a 13MP f/2.0 aperture camera with PDAF and an LED flash and at the front there is a 5MP unit with an f/2.0 aperture.");
